# T2S-Converter
A Text-to-speech synthesizer is an application that converts text into spoken word. Here,we developed a useful text-to-speech synthesizer in the form of a simple application that converts inputted text into synthesized speech and reads out to the user which can then be saved as an mp3.file. The development of a text to speech synthesizer will be of great help to people with visual impairment and make making through large volume of text easier. If you need a way to generate speech from text, the latest Appercept AWS SDK for Delphi supports Text-to-Speech (TTS) using Amazon Polly. This great solution works smoothly both for desktop and cross platform apps.
